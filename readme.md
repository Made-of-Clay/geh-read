# *Green Eggs & Ham* Reader

This repo will be a home for the various attempts I'll make at writing a reader to parse the text of *Green Eggs & Ham* and generate a word count (total words & count per word). It appears the [limited word count was the source of inspiration for Dr. Seuss' classic](https://www.drseussart.com/do-you-like-green-eggs-and-ham#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1543344009648_38855).

This will be a fun exercise, if nothing else, but it may also serve as a focus for learning other languages and writing scripts/algorithms.

## Objective

Grab the text, and generate a report of how many words were used in total (should be 50) and how many repetitions per word. The report can be a fancy designed UI, a simple HTML table, or some STD out text, but try to have fun and be creative. ðŸ˜‰
